    "The most extreme values could be considered outliers and be removed from the dataset so that they do not negatively influence the model. However, in this case, the extreme values are legitimate observations and they are most likely not incorrectly entered data. Therefore, instead of removing them, it has been decided to include some prediction models that are robust to outliers. For example, random forests and decision trees isolate atypical observations into small leaves, and the RANSAC algorithm provides a robust linear model estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the high variance of the final selling price of the auctions, appart from the mean absolute error, it has also been decided to use the median absolute error as a metric. This metric is not be so highly influenced by extreme values. Making final selling price predictions can help Swoopo or similar businesses to have an estimation of the money that they will earn before a group of auctions start. However, we consider it more important to have an accurate estimation of groups of several auctions (for example, accurate weekly or monthly profit estimations, which can be calculated by using the estimations of the final price of the auctions included in those time periods), rather than accurate estimations for individual auctions, since Swoopo will profit of the total result of all of their auctions. Because of this reason, although the mean absolute error has been calculated, the median absolute error is considered to be a more appropiate metric in this case.\n",

    "The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) has also been considered as a metric. Nevertheless, if a video game is predicted to reach a selling price of 20\\$, and the real selling price ends up being 30\\$,the MAPE would be 33%. However, if a laptop is predicted to reach a selling price of 700\\$ and the real selling price ends up being 800\\$, the MAPE is only 12.50%, but there is a prediction error of 100\\$ between the predicted price and the final price, which can have a higher impact in the business than the error in the video game prediction. For this reason, it has been decided not to use a metric that indicates a percentage."

    "Furthermore, during the training part of the model, the product category clusters are obtained, and these clusters are the ones that are used each time that a new prediction is made. After some time, more and more new products will begin to be auctioned, which will not have been considered to form the clusters. Because of this result, the clusters may eventually become outdated, and the models will perform worse. Therefore, appart from the preprocessing step, using the product categories also involves having to retrain the prediction models from time to time."
